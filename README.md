# CAMERA APPLICATION

![](LOGO_240x320.jpg)

Camera application on a bare-metal platform that streams video from an OV7670 camera to an ILI9341 SPI display, with photo capture and saving to an SD card. The system uses double-buffering to reduce memory consumption, achieving a frame rate of ~13 FPS by utilizing DMA for efficient data transfers. User input is handled by two buttons with three press modes. Photos are saved in JPEG format on the SD card via SDIO and FatFS, using the LIBJPEG library.

NOTE: RTC(RealTime Clock) module is not used for FATFS in this project, so all saved images have the same hardcoded date & time.

## How to use:
### 1. Idle Mode
- **Purpose**: Acts as the default or home screen.
- **Interaction**: Press the **Left button** once to enter **VideoFinder Mode**.

### 2. VideoFinder Mode
- **Purpose**: Displays a live video feed and allows photo capture.
- **Interactions**:
  - **Left button single press**: Takes a photo.
  - **Right button single press**: Switches to **Photo Viewer Mode**.
  - **Left button double press**: Returns to **Idle Mode**.

### 3. Photo Viewer Mode
- **Purpose**: Enables browsing of saved images on the SD card.
- **Interactions**:
  - **Left/Right button single press**: Navigates through saved images (JPEG photos) on the SD cardâ€™s root directory.
  - **Right button double press**: Returns to **VideoFinder Mode**. 

This setup allows easy navigation: the **Idle Mode** is the home base, the **VideoFinder Mode** provides real-time video and photo capture, and the **Photo Viewer Mode** facilitates browsing through photos.

## ðŸš€ New Feature: Bootloader with Self-Update Capability ðŸš€

Our camera project now includes an advanced Bootloader that not only updates the application firmware but also updates itself! With a small size (~23K) it designed for seamless field upgrades, it leverages an SD card to manage firmware updates with built-in version control and CRC validation.
